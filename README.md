## JS Pet Project - Phurten Jang Sherpa
 
**Name:** Zen Mode
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Description

Zen Mode is a simple, calming app that helps students deal with stress, anxiety, and burnout.  
When the app opens, it asks **"How are you feeling right now?"** — and based on your mood, it suggests a short meditation, breathing exercise, or even a power nap.  

The design is clean and minimal, inspired by peaceful ideas from Buddhist and Japanese philosophy.  
It’s made for busy college days when you need a few minutes to feel balanced and recharged.
